## Git Configuration

### Repository Setup
- **GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/chan-del/cccs106-projects](https://github.com/chan-del/cccs106-projects)  
- **Local Repository:** ✅ Initialized and connected  
- **Commit History:** Multiple commits with descriptive messages (see screenshots below)  

### Git Skills Demonstrated

- **Status:** ✅ Completed  
- **Features:** Interactive greeting, student info display, dialog boxes  
- **UI Components:** `Text`, `TextField`, `Button`, `Dialog`, `Container`  
- **Notes:** Smooth implementation, tested successfully  

### 2. personal_info_gui.py
- **Status:** ✅ Completed  
- **Features:** Form inputs, dropdowns, radio buttons, profile generation  
- **UI Components:** `TextField`, `Dropdown`, `RadioGroup`, `Container`, scrolling layout

## Technical Skills Developed

### Git Version Control
- Understanding of repository setup and remote syncing  
- Basic Git workflow (`add`, `commit`, `push`)  
- Branch management (create, merge, delete)  
- Conflict resolution and remote collaboration  

### Flet GUI Development
- Mastery of Flet 0.28.3 syntax and components  
- Layout management using containers and responsive design  
- Event handling for interactive features  
- Error handling and user-friendly interfaces

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Merge Conflict in `.gitignore`:** Resolved by manually editing the file and committing the correct version.  
- **Virtual Environment in Git:** Initially tracked by Git, but later excluded using `.gitignore`.  

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience with **Git branching and merging**.  
- Learned how to build **cross-platform GUI apps** using Flet.  
- Understood the importance of **clear commit messages** and version control discipline.  
- Improved ability to debug and handle errors in both Git and Python GUI development.
